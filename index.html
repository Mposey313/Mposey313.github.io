                                                                                                                          <p>My name is McArthur Posey. I am currently enrolled at Southwestern University in pursuit of earning my Computer Programming Technology Degree. I currently serve in the United States Air Force. My job title is Loadmaster. I am married with two children, a boy and a girl. A few things in life I enjoy are video games, Marvel movies and relaxing on a beach whenever I can find one. 
I also am very interested in technology and all the advances that it is making. Ever since I was a child I was interested in computers. I would always take apart my mother's laptops and try to upgrade their RAM or Hard Drives just doing the basic things. So, I decided why not try and get a degree in a field you love and so here I am creating a website and it's been great so far.
